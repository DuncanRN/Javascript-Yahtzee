## Brief:

MVP

User should be able to roll dice, then select which dice to roll again, up to three times in total.

The user can then select a scoring category for this turn.

The current game is persisted both in state and in the database.

The program should automatically calculate the users score.

Have up to 6 players, with a scorecard matching the rulebook of Yahtzee.

Have a statistics page with details of previous games, hi scores etc.

A whole other card game Pairs/Pelmanism.
